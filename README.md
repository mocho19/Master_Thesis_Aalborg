Decentralized Identity Verification System for International Students Academic Degree Attainment

A school database protects data. Most of these resources are inaccessible without interoperability. Students' opportunities are hampered by lack of academic control. An open self-sovereign protocol field for students is proposed. Personal data and identity control online is enabled by a set of technology standards and community-supported concepts. The SSI design system also gives students more control over their academic records. SSI also checks academic records. Its growing popularity may also help institutions recruit qualified international students. The verifiable credential has also raised student rights and privacy awareness. We have always prioritized user privacy. International universities benefit from SSI technology concepts that expose system flaws. The SSI system concept can also handle data over-release and record blocking. This report addresses the issue by demonstrating SSI standards and technologies. Adopt and test findings after considering specific principles and technologies. This report will also look into individual data control. Individuals and users refer to students seeking an internationally recognized degree.
